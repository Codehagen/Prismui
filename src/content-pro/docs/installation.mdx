## Prerequisites

Before setting up PrismUI Pro, ensure you have:

1. A valid PrismUI Pro license
2. Node.js 18+ installed
3. pnpm package manager installed

## Installation

### Step 1: Extract the Project

After purchasing PrismUI Pro, you'll receive a zip file containing the complete project. Extract this file to your desired location:

```bash
unzip prismui-pro.zip
cd prismui-pro
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 3: Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your specific configuration values.

### Step 4: Start Development Server

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your Pro application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

### TypeScript Configuration

Pro components include full TypeScript support. Ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/components/pro/*": ["./components/pro/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tailwind Configuration

Some pro components require additional Tailwind plugins. Add these to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
  ],
}
```

## Building for Production

To build your Pro application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

To start the production server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

If you encounter installation errors:

1. Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed
2. Clear your package manager cache: `pnpm store prune`
3. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `pnpm install` again

### Development Server Issues

If the development server won't start:

1. Check that port 3000 is available
2. Verify your environment variables in `.env.local`
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
