# Introduction

Welcome to PrismUI, a collection of beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. PrismUI is built on top of [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of reusable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

## Features

- Copy and paste - Use components directly in your app
- Accessible - All components follow WAI-ARIA guidelines
- Customizable - Easy to customize with Tailwind CSS
- Fast - Built with performance in mind
- Dark mode - Built-in dark mode support
- TypeScript - Written in TypeScript for type safety
- React Server Components - Built for the App Router

## FAQ

### Why not use a component library?

The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code. You can read the code, modify it, and maintain it yourself.

### Can I use this in my project?

Yes. Free to use for personal and commercial projects. No attribution required.

### What do I need to know to use these components?

You need to be familiar with:
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
